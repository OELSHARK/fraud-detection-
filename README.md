# **Credit Card Fraud Detection**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. It leverages advanced techniques to handle the highly imbalanced dataset, ensuring accurate classification of fraud cases.

---

## **Dataset**
- **Source:** Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
- **Features:** PCA-transformed variables (V1 to V28) and `Amount`.
- **Target:** `Class` (0 = Not Fraud, 1 = Fraud).
- **Challenge:** Highly imbalanced dataset with fraud transactions < 1%.

---

## **Models Used**
The following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:
1. **Ensemble Methods:**
   - Stacking
   - Random Forest
   - Bagging
   - Gradient Boosting
   - XGBoost
2. **Simple Models:**
   - Decision Tree
   - SVM
   - KNN
   - Logistic Regression

---

## **Steps Taken**
### **1. Preprocessing**
- **Scaling:** Applied `MinMaxScaler` to normalize feature values.
- **Handling Imbalance:**
  - Oversampling using SMOTE.
  - Undersampling using RandomUnderSampler.
- **Feature Selection:** Removed highly correlated features to reduce redundancy.

### **2. Model Training & Evaluation**
- Metrics used:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
  - **F1-Score**
  - **ROC-AUC**
- Models were trained and compared to find the most effective for fraud detection.

---

## **Results**
- **Best Performing Model:** TBD after evaluation.
- Fraud detection significantly improved while minimizing false negatives.
